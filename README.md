## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Hee Jae.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at USC Marshall, where Iâ€™m building my skills in data analytics, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I have a passion for applying data-driven approaches to solve complex business problems and uncover actionable insights.

ðŸ’¡ With hands-on project experience in machine learning and business strategy, my focus is on leveraging data to drive better decision-making and operational improvements. Iâ€™m always looking to expand my knowledge and explore new ways to use data creatively.
